# Deployment Trigger File
# Created: 2025-01-30T01:40:00Z
# Purpose: Force Render redeploy to fix 404 root endpoint issue
# Status: TRIGGER FILE CREATED

## Issue Summary:
- Root endpoint (/) returning 404
- API endpoints working fine
- Deployment appears to be stuck
- Need to force fresh deployment

## Action Required:
This file will trigger a new deployment cycle on Render
Expected resolution time: 2-5 minutes after push

## Verification:
After deployment, test:
- https://links-management-tool.onrender.com/ (should return 200)
- https://links-management-tool.onrender.com/api (should return 200)
- https://links-management-tool.onrender.com/health (should return 200)

## Notes:
- HealthController.java was updated with root endpoints
- Changes should resolve the 404 issue
- If this fails, manual redeploy via Render dashboard required
